# Easy-Diagnosis
My graduation project, "Easy Diagnosis," is a system that uses machine learning models to provide early and accurate diagnoses for three different diseases. This system aims to simplify and streamline the diagnostic process, making it easier for healthcare professionals and patients to identify and address these diseases efficiently.
